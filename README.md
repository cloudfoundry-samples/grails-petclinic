Grails Pet Clinic application
=============================

This is a Grails port of the standard Spring Pet Clinic web application. It's very simple, consisting of a few domain classes for persistence and three controllers to support the user interface.

The application uses manual configuration to discover the database service bound to the application when pushed to Cloud Foundry, as described in the [Cloud Foundry documentation](http://docs.cloudfoundry.com/docs/using/services/grails-service-bindings.html). View the `grails-app/conf/DataSource.groovy` file to see how the database configuration is done. 

### The domain model

This is the basic domain model for the Pet Clinic application:

               Person               Clinic
              /      \
          Owner      Vet
            |         |
           Pet    Speciality
          /   \
    PetType  Visit

An `Owner` has many `Pet`s, which in turn has many `Visit`s and a `PetType`. A `Vet` has many `Speciality`s. `Clinic` is on its own, but has a controller dedicated to it.

## Building and running locally

To build and run this application, use the following command:

    $ ./grailsw run-app

This will start the application in development mode and use an in-memory HSQLDB database.

*Note:* The first time the `./grailsw` command is run, it will take a while to download the Grails framework. Subsequent Grails commands will run much faster.

*Note:* If the `./grailsw` command fails because `/WEB-INF/applicationContext.xml` is missing, run `./grailsw upgrade` and try again.

## Deploying to Cloud Foundry

To run the application on Cloud Foundry, first build the project into a .war file:

    $ ./grailsw prod war

After installing the 'cf' [command-line interface for Cloud Foundry](http://docs.cloudfoundry.com/docs/using/managing-apps/cf/),
targeting a Cloud Foundry instance, and logging in, the application can be pushed using these commands:

    $ cf push

You may need to provide a different URL for the application if the name `petclinic` has already been taking in your Cloud Foundry domain. 

When using the provided `manifest.yml` file, a MySQL service will be created and bound to the app when it is pushed. You can choose a different MySQL service or a PostgreSQL service to bind to the application.
